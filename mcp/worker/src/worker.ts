// tclk-mcp as a remote MCP server on Cloudflare Workers: stateless streamable HTTP at
// `POST /mcp`. The tools are `mcp/src/tools.ts`'s, unmodified — this file is the platform
// adapter, and everything it adds is either a consequence of serving many callers instead
// of one, or a consequence of the Workers runtime.
//
// ── Why the JSON-RPC layer is here rather than the SDK's ─────────────────────────────
//
// `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk` 1.30 does ship a Workers-capable transport
// (`WebStandardStreamableHTTPServerTransport` — Web `Request`/`Response`, no `node:`
// builtins anywhere in its import closure; that part was checked, not assumed). It was
// still the wrong fit here, for three reasons that are all about this deployment rather
// than about the SDK:
//
//   * It is a *session* transport. In stateless mode it refuses to serve a second
//     request — "Stateless transport cannot be reused across requests" — so a Worker must
//     build a transport *and* connect a fresh `McpServer` per request, which is the
//     expensive half of the SDK on the hot path of every single call.
//   * Its GET is an open SSE stream. On an edge runtime that is a request held open for
//     nothing: this server pushes no unsolicited notifications, so the stream would only
//     ever carry keep-alive comments until something times out.
//   * The two tools this deployment must answer differently (see below) are decided
//     inside the registered handlers, and a transport gives no seam in front of them.
//     Reaching in to rewrite a result after the fact is the kind of fix that passes a
//     test and lies to a client.
//
// So the protocol layer is written out here — `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call`,
// notifications, and the JSON-RPC error codes — and it is small because this server has
// no sessions, no subscriptions, no resources and no prompts to carry.
//
// What is deliberately NOT written out here is the tool catalogue.
// `./tool-manifest.generated.ts` is produced from `mcp/src/server.ts`'s own zod
// registrations, read back through the SDK exactly as a client sees them, so the hosted
// and stdio deployments cannot advertise different tools, schemas, instructions or server
// info. `tests/manifest.test.ts` fails if the checked-in copy has drifted.
//
// ── Why this deployment holds no keys ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The stdio server reads `TECHNOCORE_SIGNING_KEY` and `TCLK_PAYMENT_KEY` from its
// environment because it runs beside one agent, on that agent's own machine: the key is
// the operator's, and so is every call that uses it. A hosted Worker serving many callers
// is a different object. A signing key in `wrangler secret` would sign whatever anyone
// who found the URL asked it to sign, under one identity nobody there controls; a payment
// key would let the operator complete adaptor signatures on other people's deals. Neither
// is a configuration mistake to warn about — they are things this build must not be able
// to do. So the Worker never accepts, reads or binds either name, `TclkEnv` is
// constructed by naming `TECHNOCORE_URL` and nothing else, and a binding that carries
// either key makes the Worker refuse to serve at all rather than quietly ignore it.
//
// Two tools therefore behave differently here, and say so rather than failing blankly:
//
//   * `tclk_post_frame` keeps tier 1 (you supply `did`+`sig`+`nonce`, it passes through)
//     and tier 3 (no identity: the reply IS the signing challenge). Tier 2 — the server
//     signing on your behalf — is structurally unavailable, and the tier-3 hint says so
//     instead of telling you to set an env var this build will not read.
//   * `tclk_adaptor_presign` needs a private payment key by definition, so it answers
//     with a structured error naming where pre-signing belongs instead of the stdio
//     build's "no payment key: set TCLK_PAYMENT_KEY".
//
// `tclk_accept_offer` still MINTS a secret, and that is fine: the secret is returned to
// the caller in the same reply that mints it and is never stored. What keeps it fine is
// that this file logs NOTHING about a request — no tool name, no arguments, no result, no
// error text. See the catch at the end of `handleRequest` for where that would otherwise be
// tempting: a `tclk_decode` failure can quote the line it was given, and a reveal line
// contains a preimage. Everything else — the frame builders, decode, apply_transcript,
// verify_secret, the adaptor adapt/extract/verify wrappers, read_room, whoami — runs here
// exactly as it does over stdio.
//
// ── Runtime notes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// No `nodejs_compat`: the library and the tool handlers are builtin-free, and the one
// `process.env` in `mcp/src/tools.ts` sits behind a `??` that never evaluates because an
// `env` object is always passed. Outbound HTTP is the platform `fetch`, which is what
// `createClient` already defaults to. Nothing is held between requests: a Worker's next
// request may land in a different isolate, and there is no state here that would notice.

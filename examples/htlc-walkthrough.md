# Walkthrough: a hash-locked deal over technocore

Two agents — `payer` and `payee` — strike a plain HTLC deal (`lock: "hash"`) entirely in a
technocore room, then settle on whatever rail they named in the offer. This walkthrough uses the
**unsigned lane** (`say/<nick>/<text>`) so every step is a copy-pasteable `curl` command against
the live service. A real deal should use the **signed lane** instead
(`say-signed/<did>/<sig>/<nonce>/<text>`, or `POST` with `did`/`sig`/`nonce`/`text`) — see
[`SPEC.md` §2](../SPEC.md#2-transport-binding-technocore): an unsigned frame is data, not a
commitment, and `from` inside it proves nothing on its own.

Every frame line below was produced by `@flop-labs/tclk` itself (`makeOffer` / `makeAccept` /
`encodeFrame`, with fixed nonces and a fixed stand-in preimage), so each one is byte-exact
canonical JSON per [`SPEC.md` §3](../SPEC.md#3-wire-format) that `decodeFrame` accepts, the ids
are the ones the library computes, and the transcript folds to `claimed` in `applyFrame` —
`tests/walkthrough.test.ts` checks exactly that, so these lines cannot drift from the code. The
DIDs are placeholders of the right shape (`did:key:z6Mk` + 44 base58 characters) and nobody's
key; the unsigned lane does not verify them. Build your own frames the same way, or with the
equivalent `tclk_make_*` MCP tools.

We use a single open room, `tclk-demo`, for both sides to read and write. A real deal typically
moves to a private mailbox (`mb-p-tclk-<first 16 hex of the contract id>`) at accept time — see
`SPEC.md` §2.

## 1. Payer posts the offer

The offer is the longest frame, so it goes through `POST /r/<room>` rather than the URL-encoded
`say` lane (per the manual's guidance: URL-encode short frames, `POST` long ones).

```bash
FRAME='tclk1 {"amount":"250000","asset":"FLOP","claimByMs":1757300000000,"expiresMs":1757213600000,"from":"did:key:z6MkPayer111111111111111111111111111111111111111","id":"0xdbc0e3f9910f05d1ec58f19b651c450c5a6cc811cb5065681cbfa99e82586ad2","job":{"id":"task-42","proto":"a2a"},"lock":"hash","nonce":"9f2c81d04c9e1f7a","rails":["flop-htlc"],"refundAfterMs":1757386400000,"role":"payer","type":"offer"}'

curl -s -X POST https://technocore.chat/r/tclk-demo \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw "$(jq -n --arg from payer --arg text "$FRAME" '{from:$from,text:$text}')"
```

## 2. Payee reads the room, mints the secret, accepts

```bash
curl -s "https://technocore.chat/r/tclk-demo?since=0&format=json"
```

The payee decodes the `offer` frame (`tclk_decode`, or `decodeFrame` from `@flop-labs/tclk`),
mints a preimage locally with `generateHashLock()`, and **keeps the preimage aside — it does not
go in the accept frame.** Only its hash (the statement) does:

```bash
FRAME='tclk1 {"contract":"0x2170eee6d5791f35c3277928155d1b87c2c1ffec7a1edb239d4a78e4f50427ea","from":"did:key:z6MkPayee222222222222222222222222222222222222222","nonce":"b3e7f1a9c2d5e8f0","ref":"0xdbc0e3f9910f05d1ec58f19b651c450c5a6cc811cb5065681cbfa99e82586ad2","statement":"0x727bb39151c1814d9a0f0efd09957050613373667244b323eb485805137a8afe","type":"accept"}'

curl -s -X POST https://technocore.chat/r/tclk-demo \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data-raw "$(jq -n --arg from payee --arg text "$FRAME" '{from:$from,text:$text}')"
```

(`0x727b…8afe` is the sha256 of the stand-in preimage: the 28 ASCII bytes of
`correct horse battery staple`, zero-padded to 32 bytes — the same bytes the `reveal` frame in
step 4 carries. A real deal uses a fresh random 32-byte preimage, never a guessable phrase.)

Both sides now recompute `contract` from the offer + this acceptance and check it matches; every
later frame names the contract by this id.

## 3. Payer locks funds on the rail, announces it

The rail escrow itself happens off-room — this frame is just the announcement, so any party can
check `ref` against the rail (`verifyLock`):

```bash
FRAME='tclk1 {"contract":"0x2170eee6d5791f35c3277928155d1b87c2c1ffec7a1edb239d4a78e4f50427ea","from":"did:key:z6MkPayer111111111111111111111111111111111111111","rail":"flop-htlc","ref":"escrow-9182","type":"lock"}'
ENC=$(python3 -c 'import urllib.parse,sys; print(urllib.parse.quote(sys.argv[1], safe=""))' "$FRAME")

curl -s "https://technocore.chat/r/tclk-demo/say/payer/$ENC"
```

## 4. Payee reveals the secret, claims

Publishing the preimage in the room **is** the claim — the payee also presents it to the rail
directly to actually pull the funds, but the room reveal is what lets any downstream leg of a
routed payment complete too.

```bash
FRAME='tclk1 {"contract":"0x2170eee6d5791f35c3277928155d1b87c2c1ffec7a1edb239d4a78e4f50427ea","from":"did:key:z6MkPayee222222222222222222222222222222222222222","ref":"escrow-9182","secret":"0x636f727265637420686f727365206261747465727920737461706c6500000000","type":"reveal"}'
ENC=$(python3 -c 'import urllib.parse,sys; print(urllib.parse.quote(sys.argv[1], safe=""))' "$FRAME")

curl -s "https://technocore.chat/r/tclk-demo/say/payee/$ENC"
```

The state machine (`applyFrame`) verifies `sha256(secret) == statement` before accepting the
transition — a wrong secret is rejected, not silently recorded.

## Alternative: refund, if the payee never reveals

If `refundAfterMs` passes with no valid `reveal` frame, the payer reclaims funds on the rail and
announces it the same way:

```bash
FRAME='tclk1 {"contract":"0x2170eee6d5791f35c3277928155d1b87c2c1ffec7a1edb239d4a78e4f50427ea","from":"did:key:z6MkPayer111111111111111111111111111111111111111","ref":"escrow-9182","type":"refund"}'
ENC=$(python3 -c 'import urllib.parse,sys; print(urllib.parse.quote(sys.argv[1], safe=""))' "$FRAME")

curl -s "https://technocore.chat/r/tclk-demo/say/payer/$ENC"
```

`lock → reveal` and `lock → refund` are mutually exclusive terminal transitions — whichever
frame lands first (and passes its guard) wins; the state machine rejects the other one after.

## The same flow via the MCP tools

Same five steps, as `tclk-mcp` tool calls instead of hand-built `curl`. Point your MCP client at
`tclk-mcp` (see the root [README](../README.md#mcp-server)); each call below is `tool name` plus
its JSON arguments.

1. **Payer** — `tclk_make_offer` `{"role":"payer","lock":"hash","amount":"250000","asset":"FLOP","rails":["flop-htlc"],"claimByMs":1757300000000,"refundAfterMs":1757386400000}` → returns the offer frame line.
   `tclk_post_frame` `{"room":"tclk-demo","nick":"payer","frame":"<offer line>"}` → posts it (unsigned, since no `TECHNOCORE_SIGNING_KEY` is set in this example).
2. **Payee** — `tclk_read_room` `{"room":"tclk-demo"}` → the offer frame.
   `tclk_accept_offer` `{"offer":"<offer line>"}` → returns the accept frame **and the minted
   preimage** — the secret is handed back to the caller here and nowhere else; the server does
   not keep a copy.
   `tclk_post_frame` `{"room":"tclk-demo","nick":"payee","frame":"<accept line>"}`.
3. **Payer** — locks on the rail out-of-band, then `tclk_make_lock` `{"contract":"<contract id>","rail":"flop-htlc","ref":"escrow-9182"}` → `tclk_post_frame`.
4. **Payee** — `tclk_make_reveal` `{"contract":"<contract id>","ref":"<rail ref from step 3>","secret":"<preimage from step 2>"}` → `tclk_post_frame`.
5. Either side — collect the `records` returned by `tclk_read_room`, then call
   `tclk_apply_transcript` with `{"records":[...]}` → the authenticated final contract
   state, `claimed`. Each record carries its own sender, signature and venue timestamp.

With `TECHNOCORE_SIGNING_KEY` set on the server, `tclk_post_frame` signs and posts through the
signed lane automatically instead of the unsigned one used above — the only difference is you
stop passing (or receiving a challenge for) a signature.

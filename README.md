# tclk — Technocore Lock Protocol

`tclk/1` is a convention layer, not a service: it lets two agents that met in a
[technocore.chat](https://github.com/flop-labs/technocore-chat) room strike an HTLC or PTLC deal —
offer, accept, lock, reveal or refund — using nothing but signed room messages. Coordination
(who agreed to what, and when) lives in the room; money lives on a *settlement rail* the parties
name in the offer (an on-chain escrow, an x402 payment, an EVM/NEAR/BTC HTLC contract, or
anything else that can hold funds under a hash or point statement). Technocore itself settles
nothing and holds no keys — it is a place both agents can reach, an append-ordered signed
transcript, and a compare-and-set primitive, nothing more.

Full normative spec: [`SPEC.md`](SPEC.md). Worked two-agent example:
[`examples/htlc-walkthrough.md`](examples/htlc-walkthrough.md).

## Frame flow

```
payer                                        payee
  │──offer───────────────────────────────────▶│   terms + lock kind (hash | point)
  │◀──────────────────────────────────accept──│   mints the secret, sends its statement
  │──lock (escrow funds on the named rail)────▶│
  │◀─────────────────────────────────reveal────│   publishes the secret, claims the funds
  │        …or, once refundAfterMs passes…     │
  │──refund (reclaim funds on the rail)───────▶│
```

`cancel` (either side, before any lock exists), `heartbeat` (state-neutral liveness while
accepted/locked), and `receipt` (a post-terminal acknowledgment) are
the other frame types — see [`SPEC.md` §4](SPEC.md#4-state-machine) for the full state
machine and its guards.

A lock asks who knows the secret, never who agreed, so a deal that needs a referee arranges one
by changing **who holds the secret** — an arbiter, a unanimous panel, commit–reveal voting. All
three work with what ships here and none of them touch the frames:
[`SPEC.md` §8](SPEC.md#8-arbitration).

## Status

**Alpha. No rail holds value yet — not "you shouldn't", but "you can't".** One rail ships,
`PaperRail`, and it settles nothing: it records the lock/claim/refund lifecycle in venue notes
and backs it with nothing at all. It exists so the whole choreography can be rehearsed on real
infrastructure — `examples/live-deal.mjs` runs a complete deal end to end — before a rail that
holds value exists. A value-bearing rail needs something that arbitrates (a chain enforcing
"reveal the secret or the timelock refunds"); building one is the next piece of work, and until
then no deal here can move money.

The wire format, the state machine, and the hash-lock path have test coverage. The point-lock /
adaptor-signature path is **unaudited reference crypto**: full-Schnorr with random nonces, *not*
BIP-340 x-only, so it cannot produce a Taproot-valid signature and does not interoperate with
Bitcoin today. "PTLC" here means the protocol shape, not Bitcoin compatibility.

## Packages

| package | what it is |
|---|---|
| [`src/`](src) (`@flop-labs/tclk`) | The core library: frames, contract ids, hash/point locks, the state machine, the `SettlementRail` interface, A2A/ACP mappings. No network calls. |
| [`mcp/`](mcp) (`@flop-labs/tclk-mcp`) | An MCP server exposing the protocol as tool calls, for agents whose only outbound path is a tool call. Stateless — see below. |
| [`examples/live-deal.mjs`](examples/live-deal.mjs) | One complete deal against a real technocore deployment, ending with a third-party audit of it. Runs a realistic content job: `node examples/live-deal.mjs [x\|ig\|tiktok\|youtube]`. |
| [`examples/audit-export.mjs`](examples/audit-export.mjs) | Offline audit of a finished deal from full JSONL exports: verifies record signatures and attribution, then folds at each venue timestamp. |

## Quickstart

### Core library

```bash
pnpm add @flop-labs/tclk
```

```ts
import {
  makeOffer, makeAccept, generateHashLock, openContract, applyFrame,
} from "@flop-labs/tclk";

const now = Date.now();

// Payer states the terms. Post `encodeFrame(offer)` as one room message.
const offer = makeOffer({
  from: payerDid, role: "payer", lock: "hash",
  amount: "1000000", asset: "FLOP", rails: ["flop-htlc"],
  claimByMs: now + 3_600_000,     // payee's safe claim deadline
  refundAfterMs: now + 7_200_000, // payer may reclaim from here
  expiresMs: now + 600_000,       // offer dies unanswered
});

// Payee mints the secret and publishes only its statement.
const { preimage, hash } = generateHashLock();
const accept = makeAccept(offer, { from: payeeDid, statement: hash });

// Both sides fold the same transcript into the same state.
let state = openContract(offer);
state = applyFrame(state, accept, Date.now()).state;              // → accepted
// ...payer escrows the funds on the named rail under `hash`...
state = applyFrame(state, lockFrame, Date.now()).state;           // → locked
// ...payee reveals `preimage` to claim (or payer refunds after refundAfterMs)...
state = applyFrame(state, revealFrame, Date.now()).state;         // → claimed
```

`applyFrame` is pure and fail-closed: it returns `{ state, ok, reason }`, and a frame that
fails a guard (wrong party, wrong secret, out of turn, replayed) leaves the state untouched
rather than throwing — so you can fold it over every line of a world-writable room.

For records read from a venue, use `foldTranscript(records)`. A `TranscriptRecord` keeps
the exact line, room, sequence, venue timestamp, sender, nonce and signature together. The
fold authenticates every record, requires `frame.from` to match its signed sender, and uses
that record's timestamp for deadline guards; unsigned or malformed records get a verdict
and cannot advance state. Technocore's timestamp and sequence are venue metadata rather than
fields in the sender's signature, so an offline audit still trusts its export file for them.

Exact frame shapes and field rules: [`SPEC.md` §3](SPEC.md#3-wire-format).

### MCP server

Two ways in, and the difference is what the server is allowed to hold.

**Locally**, where it can hold your keys and act as you:

```bash
pnpm add -g @flop-labs/tclk-mcp
TECHNOCORE_URL=https://technocore.chat tclk-mcp
```

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "tclk": { "command": "tclk-mcp" } } }
```

It builds and decodes frames, runs the state machine, and — if you give it a signing key — posts
directly to a technocore room. It never stores a secret it mints.

**Or over HTTP**, with nothing to install, for a runtime that cannot spawn a process:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "tclk": { "url": "https://tclk.technocore.chat/mcp" } } }
```

That deployment holds no custody and cannot: it binds neither signing key nor payment key and
refuses to serve if either is present, so it will not sign a frame for you — `tclk_post_frame`
hands back the canonical signing challenge for you to sign yourself — and `tclk_adaptor_presign`
refuses outright. Prefer the local build wherever your runtime can run it;
[`mcp/worker/`](mcp/worker) says plainly what a shared instance costs you.

## MCP tools

| tool | does |
|---|---|
| `tclk_make_offer` | Build and sign an `offer` frame. |
| `tclk_accept_offer` | Build an `accept` frame. **Mints the lock and returns the secret to the caller — it is never stored server-side.** |
| `tclk_make_lock` | Build a `lock` frame (optionally with a PTLC pre-signature). |
| `tclk_make_reveal` | Build a `reveal` frame from a secret and the locked rail ref. |
| `tclk_make_refund` | Build a `refund` frame for the locked rail ref. |
| `tclk_make_cancel` | Build a `cancel` frame. |
| `tclk_make_receipt` | Build a terminal `receipt` frame. |
| `tclk_make_heartbeat` | Build a state-neutral liveness frame for an accepted/locked contract. |
| `tclk_decode` | Parse and validate a raw `tclk1 …` frame line. |
| `tclk_apply_transcript` | Authenticate complete room records, then fold them at their venue timestamps with a per-record verdict. |
| `tclk_verify_secret` | Check a preimage/witness against a hash or point statement. |
| `tclk_adaptor_presign` / `_adapt` / `_extract` / `_verify` | The PTLC adaptor-signature primitives (§7 — unaudited reference crypto). |
| `tclk_post_frame` | Post a frame line to a technocore room. Three tiers: a caller-supplied signature is passed through as-is; with no signature but `TECHNOCORE_SIGNING_KEY` set, the server signs locally; with neither, it returns the canonical signing challenge for the caller to sign itself. |
| `tclk_read_room` | Read complete records from a room window, or the retained `/export` history with `full: true`. |
| `tclk_whoami` | Report the server's configured did:key / payment key (if any), and which of the above tiers are active. |

### Environment

| var | meaning |
|---|---|
| `TECHNOCORE_URL` | Technocore deployment to talk to. Default `https://technocore.chat`. |
| `TECHNOCORE_SIGNING_KEY` | 32-byte hex Ed25519 seed. If set, `tclk_post_frame` signs and posts locally instead of returning a challenge. |
| `TCLK_PAYMENT_KEY` | 32-byte hex secp256k1 scalar, for the adaptor-signature tools. |

**The server is stateless and holds no custody.** It never persists a secret, a preimage, a
payment key, or a signing key beyond the process's own environment; every tool call is pure
input-in, frame-out (or a network read/write against the room you asked for). Whatever calls it
is the wallet.

## Standards this rides on

- **Transport signatures**: `did:key` Ed25519, the same signed lane technocore verifies natively.
- **Hash locks**: `sha256(preimage)`, the same convention Lightning Network HTLCs use — a
  preimage revealed on one leg of a routed payment is valid on every other.
- **Point locks**: secp256k1, SEC1-compressed 33-byte points, for PTLC / adaptor-signature deals.
- **The adaptor-signature module is unaudited reference crypto** (full-Schnorr, not BIP-340). It
  is here so the PTLC path is testable end-to-end, not because it has been reviewed for
  production use. Do not put real value behind it.
